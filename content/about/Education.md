## Master of Science in Information Technology
**Institution:** University of Massachusetts - Lowell    
**Location:** Lowell, MA    
**Date Completed:** February 2023

- **Cloud Computing**  
  Studied distributed systems, virtualization, and cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). Deployed and secured cloud environments using AWS and Azure. Covered containerization, orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes), and cloud automation.

- **Network Security Design**  
  Designed secure network architectures using VLANs, firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS systems. Applied zero-trust principles and segmentation strategies. Performed network threat modeling and built defense-in-depth strategies.

- **Digital Forensics and Malware Analysis**  
  Conducted memory and disk forensic analysis using tools like Autopsy, Volatility, and Wireshark. Analyzed malware behavior in sandbox environments. Learned chain-of-custody procedures and evidence preservation.

- **Risk Assessment and Management**  
  Performed qualitative and quantitative risk assessments using frameworks like NIST 800-30 and ISO 27005. Created risk registers, mitigation plans, and control mappings to NIST CSF and ISO 27001 standards.

- **Database Design and Implementation**  
  Designed relational databases using SQL and ER diagrams. Implemented secure, normalized schemas and query optimization. Explored access controls, encryption, and backups to secure sensitive data in transit and at rest.
