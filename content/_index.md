## Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio
My name is Thom Gagnon

I started this portfolio to showcase my projects and give a reference for my Skills, Education, and Certifications

I am an Information technology professional with a strong academic foundation (B.S. and M.S. in Information technology) and multiple industry-recognized certifications, including SANS and ISC². Experienced as a Desktop Support and EMR Migration Specialist in the Healthcare industry, a SysAdmin and Helpdesk Lead at an MSP, System Administrator and Project Manager in the Defense industry. I am passionate about applying my security education to real-world problems—whether in cloud security, detection engineering, or threat response. I thrive on solving complex, evolving challenges and enjoy working with teams that value staying ahead of emerging technologies. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute to building secure, scalable systems and continuously grow alongside forward-thinking teams.
